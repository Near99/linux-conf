# Personal Backup

Recently I got really into Linux customization and configuration.

Things started from text editor. I've been using VSCode for a while.

I really like VSCode except for one thing, the themes.

There's not a single theme I used for more than a week.

Not a single theme that could let my eyes stayed comfortable after hours of coding.

I tried numbers of font and theme combinations, however none of theme I got quite happy with.

One month ago I accidentally found a Youtube video about VIM customization and the gruvbox theme heuses looks pretty good, better than on VSCode.

I didn't give much thought on it at first as my main focus is learning how to code!

Util like a week ago I felt I couldn't bear it any longer and decided to switch to VIM.

Along with customizing VIM I realized that I also need a better window manager to reduce the time
I spend on arranging windows.

Then here I am!

My current distro is Ubuntu 20.04.02 and I am gonna switch to Arch right after I upload some of my config files here.

Main:
Terminal: kitty
Shell: zsh & oh my zsh, wanna try alacritty as well
Window Manager: awesome
Neovim

Theme:
dexpota/kitty-themes

Others:
prom: dmenu
wallpaper: nitrogen
compositor: compton
vpn: trojan
htop
ranger
git
npm
yarn
kdeconnect
scrcpy
neofetch
fire code fonts
powerlinesymbols

looking for better ones:

All of my config files are very basic and simple. mostly copied from provided examples and others.
